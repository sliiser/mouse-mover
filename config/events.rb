WebsocketRails::EventMap.describe do
  # You can use this file to map incoming events to controller actions.
  # One event can be mapped to any number of controller actions. The
  # actions will be executed in the order they were subscribed.
  #
  # Uncomment and edit the next line to handle the client connected event:
  #   subscribe :client_connected, :to => Controller, :with_method => :method_name
  #
  # Here is an example of mapping namespaced events:
  namespace :mouse do
    subscribe :create, 'mouse#create'
    subscribe :update, 'mouse#update'
    subscribe :destroy, 'mouse#destroy'
  end
end
